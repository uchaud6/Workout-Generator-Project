Programming/Markup Languages Used: HTML, CSS, Javascript

IMPORTANT: To run smoothly like in the GIF above, please be sure to save all files in the Github repository to one single folder before opening the index.html file to see the project.

Explanation of Files:

index.html: HTML file used to create layout and display webpage application which links CSS and JavaScript files for page styling and functionality purposes.

styles.css: CSS file used to give index.html specific styling to make the webpage look the way it is shown in the gif above.'

main.js: JavaScript file used to give the page the functionality of generating specific workout routines as requested by the user on the webpage.

favicon.ico: This file is needed for the image of a dumbbell to be displayed on the title tab of the webpage as it is a favicon (this favicon was retrieved by a website cited at the bottom of the index.html webpage).

backgroundIMG.webp: This file is used as a background image for design purposes

Functionality of Workout Generator Project:

Once the user reaches the page, they are directed to fill out a form to narrow down the user's equipment readily available. The exercises generated for the user will be exercises acsessible based off chosen level of equipment. The user is asked what intensity they're willing to exercise at for today and based off their choice, they will be asked to complete some number of reps before muscular failure for each set in their workout. If they choose to workout hard, they will be exercising close to failure and similarly, they will be exercising farther from failure if they choose to exercise lightly. When asked how many minutes the user plans to exercise, their choice will reflect how many exercises, sets per exercise, and minutes of rest between sets that they will complete for their workout today. If the user chooses a smaller amount of time to exercise, they'll have less exercises given to them to perform, but they will be given less rest to perform strenous activity (metabolic muscular exercise). If the user chooses a larger time to exercise, they will be given more exercises to perform, but they will have more rest between sets (Muscular Strength/Muscular Hypertrophy). Finally, after selecting a specific muscle group to exercise and clicking the "Generate Routine" button, they will have a workout routine displayed to them that will hopefully be helpful and considerate to their needs! If the user fails to make a selection in every element in the form, they will be given an error message that will last until they correctly fill out the form and resumbit their choices.

Specific Numbers/Values of Workout Routine:

When it comes to why specific numbers or attributes of the workout routine are given to the user, for example, why the user is a certain number of minutes of rest for a given time interval, etc., these certain values have been chosen based off my own experience of exercising for muscular hypertrophy and strength from the years 2020-2022 where I've exercised with different time constraints, equipment, and experimented with new exercises. Therefore, certain characterisitcs of given workout routines have certain elements like a certain amount of time of rest between sets because of professional exercise information given online, recreational advice by peers at gyms, and my own personal experience of making exercising effective and possible based on certain conditions.
